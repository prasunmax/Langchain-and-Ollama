But remember: Market sentiment keeps changing. A few sessions of strong upward movement and we will forget the woes of the past few months. So, forget the Nifty and Sensex, focus on the businesses of the stocks you own or intend to buy. Just to put things in perspective: Does FII selling and the Nifty’s movements affect the bottom line of a company showcasing an EV tractor with the promise of other EV products in the farm equipment space? Clearly not. Or a pharma company which recently got US FDA clearance for one of its plants after a long wait of over two years?FIIs maintain aggressive selling spree in Indian market, sell equities worth Rs 66,600 cr in Jan so farJan 25, 2025, 05:28 PM ISTForeign Institutional Investors (FIIs) have been consistently selling in the Indian equity markets in January, with sales in the cash market reaching Rs 66,602 crore. The primary reasons behind this trend are the strengthening of the dollar and rising US bond yields. The financial sector has been significantly impacted, while the IT sector shows signs of resilience.Geojit Financial Services Share Price 95.47-2.72 (-2.77%)Concurrent Gainers: 7 stocks that gain for 5 days in a rowJan 25, 2025, 01:19 PM ISTIn the five trading sessions leading up to January 24, the Sensex fell by approximately 0.56%, or 429 points, ending at 76,190. However, the index rose in three of those five sessions. ETMarkets identified seven stocks with a market capitalization exceeding Rs 1,000 crore that showed consistent price increases during this period. (Data Source: ACE Equity)Dalal Street Week Ahead: Technical indicators signal caution as Nifty faces resistance at 23,700Jan 25, 2025, 03:15 PM ISTThe markets remained in a very defined trading range and stayed decisively below key levels. The trading range widened a bit; the Nifty oscillated in 449.45 points before closing towards its lower end of the range. The volatility increased; the India VIX inched higher by 6.33% to 16.75 and stayed at elevated levels. Power stocks: Better placed than many. 5 power stocks from different segments with an upside potential of more than 44%Jan 25, 2025, 02:02 PM ISTWhen the market hits a bearish phase, there are some sectors that tend to do better than others. Reason: The income stream of these sectors is stable and even in an economic slowdown demand for their products is not impacted. Hence the street tends to gravitate to these sectors. One such sector is power. Now consider another aspect. With hands on heart, answer these questions. Before the announcement of its IPO, did you know that NTPC had a subsidiary called NTPC Green Energy? Or have any idea what business it did? Or, more importantly, that its IPO would get listed at more than Rs. 1 lakh crore market capitalisation? If the answers are yes, then you know all about the power sector and we need to go no further. But if not, read on, and ignore the narratives suggested by the Nifty and SensexWipro, Coforge among 30 stocks with record dates for dividends, bonuses, splits next week. Do you own any?Jan 25, 2025, 01:53 PM ISTShares of companies like Wipro, Coforge, and Persistent Systems are set to gain attention due to upcoming corporate actions such as dividends, bonus shares, and stock splits. These actions have record dates this week, including interim dividends announced by Tanla Platforms, KEI Industries, and Bharat Petroleum among others, affecting investor eligibility and engagement.Zensar Technologies Share Price 831.75-5.15 (-0.62%)Largecap stocks: How to solve for the ‘missing’ middle order?Jan 25, 2025, 01:11 PM ISTThe middle-order segment of large-cap stocks is often underrepresented in major indices, similar to unsung middle-order cricketers. BSE Sensex Next 30 Index provides a diversified opportunity to tap into these potential growth leaders, with historical outperformance but also higher risk.BULL'S EYETop 5 aggressive hybrid equity funds with up to 38% returns in 1 yearKnow why this may be the right time to buy a houseSC says no to Ganesha in Idgah MaidanCan rent agreements be made for more than 11 months?Law on wages: 5 things that are set to changeSBI ups rates of repo rate linked home loansSBI has increased its home loan external benchmark lending rate (EBLR) to 7.05 percent, while theTaliban official: At least 100 dead, wounded in Afghan blastSustainability at Tokyo Olympic 202021 stocks sending out weak signals on MACD chartsData showed 21 stocks are showing bearish trends.

While a rate cut isn't expected immediately, the Fed's easing bias and recent strong economic data will influence future decisions. Meanwhile, President Trump's upcoming policies, including potential tariffs, could impact market volatility and inflation.5 world market themes for the week aheadJan 25, 2025, 09:11 AM ISTThis week, critical economic events include the U.S. Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, and Bank of Canada's first 2025 meetings.
